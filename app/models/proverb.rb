	# Method to get a random quote for home page

    # This works, but relies on sqlite's Random() function, so not great code
    # order('Random()').first

    # Better to use the Rails alternative:
    # 'active' scope called, and 'to_a' executes query and returns an array of proverb objects
    # 'sample' is a Ruby method that randomly grabs a value (in this case, a proverb object) from an array
    self.active.to_a.sample
