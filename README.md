# 67272 Proverbs

This is a super simple Rails app that was built as a class demonstration in the spring of 2018 using Rails 5.1.4 and Ruby 2.4.3.

There are some records (SQL insert statements) that can be added to the system if you want to play with it more. These can be added either via SQLite Manager tool in Firefox or via the command line.

The class is Application Design & Development and is for Information Systems students at Carnegie Mellon University (campuses both in Pittsburgh and Doha). We have posted this code on github.com in a public directory so that (a) it is readily accessible to students in both PA and Qatar and (b) that students will get a little familiarity with github.com.  The course site for 67-272 provides additional information and can be found at [https://67272.cmuis.net/](https://67272.cmuis.net/)
